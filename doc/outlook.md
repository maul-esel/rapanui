## 8 Outlook

rapanui achieves and excels its goals as stated in the specification by providing extra convenience features such as the ability to export proofs or to revert steps taken by the user.
Of course, room further improvement and additional features always exists:

The probably most interesting possibility to extend rapanui is to support more terms and formulas, for example:

* logical operators such as `or` and `not` (`and` is functionally supported)
* formulas for inequality, proper subsets, (proper) supersets
* quantifiers,
* integer-valued terms (especially for exponents),
* infinite unions and intersections for a proper definition of transitive and reflexive-transitive closure,
* relations between different sets and the ability to specify properties of these sets

Furthermore, several convenience features might prove useful such as the ability to

* define a relationship between two terms e.g. `define R, S as "disjunct" iff R ∩ S = ∅`,
* split rule systems into multiple files and import other rule systems,
* manage rule systems via the UI,
* save proven propositions in the form of a rule system,
* detect unused premises or find minimal required premises

Lastly, 7.1 lists possible performance improvements.
