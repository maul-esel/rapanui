## 5 Suggestion and Justification Generation

### 5.1 Basic Considerations

#### Recursion

As explained in 4, a suggestion (a `Transformation` instance) always references a justification to prove its correctness. So to generate or find a possible transformation, one must also first find a justification. It becomes obvious, that algorithms for suggestion generation and justification generation would be very similar. Therefore, rapanui implements the mentioned 4 approaches for *justification* generation, and then creates transformations from the result. This is practical especially because (some) justifications reference other justifications recursively. Therefore an algorithm to generate justifications must also recurse (to justify a justification's premises), whereas the same is not true for transformations.

However, this recursion would (in most cases) be infinite. Therefore, a recursion limit must be set. To achieve acceptable performance, a limited amount of suggestions, and since the application's purpose is not to perform the entire proof automatically, this recursion limit must be very low (currently 1).

Whenever one of the algorithms requests a justification for one of its premises, it does not care which of the 4 approaches generates that justification. Therefore, a special class `AggregateJustificationFinder` delegates requests to all 4 algorithms and collects their results. So if one of the algorithms recurses, it does not call itself directly but the `AggregateJustificationFinder`.

#### Request Format

In many cases, when a justification is requested, not the entire formula that should be justified is known:

* For example, to find transformation suggestions, a justification for the formula `t = ?` is requested, where `t` is the current term and any term can take the place of the question mark.
* When searching for rule applications, a translation from the abstract variables of the rule to the concrete terms of the request must be found. This translation is not always completely known, which also leads to an incomplete formula.
* And if an incomplete formula is requested, recursive calls might also be incomplete.

In order to support all these scenarios, the justification finding algorithms take incomplete formulas and return justifications for complete formulas which match the input.

#### Correctness and Completeness

Each algorithm must ensure, that every generated suggestion or justification is (provably) correct. However, due to the infinite number of transformations on any term, completeness is not required.

#### Concurrency

The justification finding algorithms are designed to run concurrently on multiple threads to improve performance. The central piece of the implementation is the class `Emitter<T>`. It represents a list of an unknown number of instances of type `T` which might already be known or might be computed in the future.

To perform an action on each of these items, the `onEmit()` method is called with a callback method. This callback is invoked on all items that are already known and on all items that are emitted in the future. The source of these items might either be other emitters or a computation running in another thread.

`Emitter` also implements common list operations such as `map`, `flatMap`, `filter`, `combine`, `first`, all of which return new `Emitter` instances.


### 5.2 4 Approaches
This section describes the 4 algorithms used for justification generation (and indirectly, for suggestion generation). Each algorithm is given a (possible incomplete) formula (a template) and a `ProofEnvironment` and returns an `Emitter<Justification>` instance.

#### Environment Premises
The simplest approach concerns the premises given by the user. The algorithm simply iterates through the environment's premises. If a premise matches the given formula template, an `EnvironmentPremiseJustification` is created and emitted. If the premise is an equation, the reversed equation is also tested.

#### Previous Proofs
The algorithm iterates through all conclusion processes in the environment. For each conclusion process, it looks at all pairs of terms `(t1, t2)` where the proof states that `t1 = t2` (including those, where `t2` comes before `t1` in the conclusion process) or `t1 âŠ† t2` and emits those that match the given formula template.

#### Subterm Equality
If the given formula template contains only one term `t`, which is complete, the algorithm iterates through all subterms:

* For each subterm `s`, search for equal terms `r = s`.
* If found, replace the subterm with the equal term, and emit the result `t = t[r/s]` (where `t[r/s]` denotes the term which results from replacing `r` by `s` in `t`).

If however the only given term `t` is incomplete:

* Search the minimum incomplete term `z` so that the rest of the term is complete. Since the result must be a complete formula, `z` must be part of the subterm which is replaced.
* For `z` and all subterms `s` of `t` that contain it, search for two equal terms `s' = r` where `s'` matches `s`.
* If found, emit the result `t[s/s'] = t[s/r]`

Lastly, if two complete terms `t1`, `t2` are given, they must only differ in a subterm.

* Locate the minimal differing subterms `z1`, `z2`.
* For them and all pairs of subterms `(s1, s2)` that contain them, justify their equality `s1 = s2`.
* If found, wrap in a SubtermEqualityJustification and emit.

In all of these cases, sub-justifications are used. However, if the sub-justification is itself a `SubtermEqualityJustification`, it is ignored, because a subterm of a subterm of a term `t` is also a subterm of `t` and thus will be handled by the algorithm directly.

#### Rule Applications
The algorithm iterates through all conclusions of all rules. If the formula type (equation or inclusion) matches, it tries to find a mapping (a "translation") from the rule's variables to the terms in the given formula template. Since it does not take the premises into account, this mapping might be incomplete.

* Iteratively, each premise is then translated using that mapping, as far as possible.
* The resulting (possibly incomplete) formula is then justified.
* If a justification is found, it is checked for conflicts with the translation. If none are found, the translation is updated with any information derived from the justified formula.
* Using the updated translation, the next premise is (partially) translated etc.
* Once all premises are justified, the conclusion is translated and a `RuleApplication` is emitted.
