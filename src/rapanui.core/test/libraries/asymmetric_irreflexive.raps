define R as "asymmetric"
  iff R ∩ R˘ = ∅

axiom "identity is symmetric"
  always I = I˘

theorem "identity is symmetric (2)"
  if S ⊆ I
  then S = S˘

axiom "intersection is subset of arguments"
  always M ∩ N ⊆ M

axiom "converse and intersection"
  always (R ∩ S)˘ = R˘ ∩ S˘

axiom "intersection is idempotent"
  always M ∩ M = M

axiom "intersection is associative"
  always M ∩ (N ∩ L) = (M ∩ N) ∩ L

axiom "intersection is commutative"
  always M ∩ N = N ∩ M

axiom "intersection with empty set"
  always M ∩ ∅ = ∅
